# Procedurally generated Iso-world demo.

Rewritten for Love 2D 11.5

### Features:
1. World generator based on various noise maps

2. Caching tileset generator
 
3. Basic camera controls (Arrow keys - movement, "[" and "\]" are zooming keys)

### Comment:
Before, it was just pushing isometric tiles put together into the world. Anyway, this is my prototype garden for my actual engine as of now. 
Mainly to prototype renderer features elsewhere, in a more functional engine. 

I like about this iteration fact that it auto-generates it's own tileset from just a texture, I want to use it in my engine too. For more than just block objects.
However, I might still look into Z-sorting and object placement here. Perhaps I might turn this into a simple game for this to be playable. Since that would require more features.

I love isometric games, and I love certain RTS games like Age of Empires 2, Simcity 2000-4, and others. Also, I love survival games that push their format to it's limits like Project Zomboid.
Hopefully, I will be able to create my own in the future. This is essentially just a demo, but further down the line, I want something real.
